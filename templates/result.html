            <p>A neutral mood is when you're feeling neither particularly positive nor negative; it's a state of emotional balance. It's quite normal to have moments or periods of neutrality in your emotional life. Sometimes, a neutral mood can be a welcome break from intense emotions, providing a sense of calm and stability.

                If you're in a neutral mood and would like to engage in a conversation, explore a new topic, or have any specific questions or thoughts you'd like to share, feel free to let me know. I'm here to assist with any inquiries or discussions you might have, regardless of your current mood.</p>
        {% elif mood == 'Negative Mood' %}

Sharing your thoughts and concerns can often be a helpful first step in managing negative emotions. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any questions you have about improving your mood?
